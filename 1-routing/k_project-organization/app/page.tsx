          1Ô∏è‚É£ First approach is called `Safe Colocation by Default`. In this
          approach, NextJS 13`s app router won`t treat your folder as a Route,
          even though if you create a folder in somewhere in the app/,{" "}
          <b className="font-bold">until</b> you create page.tsx or route.ts
          inside of that folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          2Ô∏è‚É£ Second one is called `Private Folders`. In this approach you`re
          able to define your non-route folders with underscore (like
          app/profile/_components), app router will ignore that folder when
          scanning for routes. This means even if you create page.tsx or
          route.ts inside the private folder, Next 13`s app/ router will ignore
          that page.tsx or route.ts
        </li>
